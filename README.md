## What is TorchEasyRec?

![intro.png](docs/images/intro.png)

### TorchEasyRec is an easy-to-use framework for Recommendation

TorchEasyRec implements state of the art deep learning models used in common recommendation tasks: candidate generation(matching), scoring(ranking), and multi-task learning. It improves the efficiency of generating high performance models by simple configuration and easy customization.
